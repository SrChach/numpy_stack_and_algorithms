## Big O notation

An algorithm is simply an **procedure or formula for solving a problem**. But, due that into the computational world the *speed of execution* and the *memory usage* are too important, we need an efficient manner to measure this, independiently of each processor capacity and another factors.

This is where *Big O notation* comes into action.

**Big O** notation describes *how quickly runtime will grow relative to the input as the input get arbitrarily large*


So, *Big O* measures the quantity of operations and assignments done by an algotithm.
